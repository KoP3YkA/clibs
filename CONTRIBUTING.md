# Thanks for help!

We are very grateful to everyone who contributes to our project.

## Adding new libraries

To add ur own library, create directory in `libs`, then create `.c` and `.h` files like `lib_NAME_manager`.

Every module must be documented.

## Naming

All variables and functions must be named in `snake_case`
